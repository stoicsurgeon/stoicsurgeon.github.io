# Contributing

If you want to contribute (because something is wrong, because you have something to add, ...), feel free to send a pull request with your changes on [Github](https://github.com/stoicsurgeon/stoicsurgeon.github.io/) . The whole website just consists of plaintext Markdown files with a one-to-one mapping with github repository folder structure, so it's really easy to edit.

If you want to discuss certain aspects publicly, [create an issue](https://github.com/stoicsurgeon/stoicsurgeon.github.io/issues/new) on Github. If you want to discuss something privately, head to the about page.
